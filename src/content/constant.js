// frequently asked questions
export const faqs = [
  {
    id: 1,
    question: "What's the difference between native and cross-platform mobile apps?",
    answer: `Native apps are built specifically for one platform (iOS or Android) using platform-specific programming languages like Swift for iOS and Kotlin for Android. They offer superior performance and full access to device features.

Cross-platform apps use frameworks like React Native or Flutter to create apps that work on multiple platforms from a single codebase. While they may have slightly lower performance, they significantly reduce development time and cost.`,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "How long does it typically take to develop a mobile application?",
    answer:
      "Mobile app development timelines vary based on complexity, features, and platform requirements. Simple apps with basic functionality typically take 2-4 months, while complex applications with advanced features can take 6-12 months. We provide detailed project timelines during the planning phase.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "Should we develop for iOS, Android, or both platforms?",
    answer:
      "The platform choice depends on your target audience and business goals. iOS users tend to spend more on apps, while Android has a larger global market share. For maximum reach, we recommend cross-platform development using React Native or Flutter, which allows you to target both platforms efficiently.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "What factors influence mobile app development costs?",
    answer:
      "App development costs depend on features complexity, design requirements, platform selection, third-party integrations, and development timeline. Simple apps start around $15,000, while complex enterprise applications can cost $100,000+. We provide detailed cost breakdowns during project planning.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "How do you ensure mobile app security and data protection?",
    answer:
      "We implement industry-standard security measures including data encryption, secure API communication, regular security audits, and compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR. All apps undergo thorough security testing before deployment.",
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "Do you provide ongoing maintenance and support after app launch?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we offer comprehensive post-launch support including bug fixes, performance optimization, feature updates, and compatibility maintenance for new OS versions. We also provide analytics monitoring and user feedback integration.",
